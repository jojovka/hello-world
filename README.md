RecordFormatException: Tried to allocate an array of length 1,326,463,498, but the maximum length for this record type is 100,000,000.
If the file is not corrupt, please open an issue on bugzilla to request 
increasing the maximum allowable size for this record type.
As a temporary workaround, consider setting a higher override value with IOUtils.setByteArrayMaxOverride()
